        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi! I’m Ella, a '24 from Brooklyn, NY. I’m planning to major in Computer Science with a second major or minor in Linguistics. In my free time, I like cooking, reading, and spending time outside. I took a gap year last year and worked at an outdoor education center in Colorado and then lived in Mexico City for a few months.</p>
